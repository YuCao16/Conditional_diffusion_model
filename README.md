# Conditional Diffusion MNIST

[script.py](script.py) is a minimal, self-contained implementation of a
conditional diffusion model. It learns to generate MNIST digits, conditioned on
a class label. The neural network architecture is a small U-Net. This code is
modified from [this excellent repo](https://github.com/cloneofsimo/minDiffusion)
which does unconditional generation. The diffusion model is a
[Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239).

The conditioning roughly follows the method described in
[Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598) (also
used in [ImageGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487)). The model infuses
timestep embeddings $t_e$ and context embeddings $c_e$ with the U-Net
activations at a certain layer $a_L$, via,

<p align = "center">
$a_{L+1} = c_e  a_L + t_e.$
</p>
(Though in our experimentation, we found variants of this also work, e.g. concatenating embeddings together.)

At training time, $c_e$ is randomly set to zero with probability $0.1$, so the
model learns to do unconditional generation (say $\psi(z_t)$ for noise $z_t$ at
timestep $t$) and also conditional generation (say $\psi(z_t, c)$ for context
$c$). This is important as at generation time, we choose a weight, $w \geq 0$,
to guide the model to generate examples with the following equation,

<p align = "center">
$\hat{\epsilon}_{t} = (1+w)\psi(z_t, c) + w \psi(z_t).$

Increasing $w$ produces images that are more typical but less diverse.

Training for above models took around 20 epochs (~20 minutes).
